 Tasks To Be Performed:
 1. Destroy the previous deployments
 2. Create a script to install Apache2
 3. Run this script on a newly created EC2 instance
 4. Print the IP address of the instance in a file on the local once deployed

---
Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving your tasks using **Terraform**. The workflow includes destroying existing deployments, provisioning a new EC2 instance, installing Apache2 via a script, and printing the public IP address of the instance to a local file.

---

## âœ… Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with access key and secret
- Terraform installed (`terraform -v`)
- SSH key pair created (for instance access)
- A VPC and Subnet already available, or modify Terraform to create them

---

## ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Terraform Solution

### 1. **Destroy Previous Deployments**
If you already have Terraform state for a previous EC2 deployment:
```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

> Run this inside the directory of your existing deployment. If you're starting fresh, skip this step.

---

### 2. **Create Apache2 Installation Script**
Create a file called `install_apache.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x install_apache.sh
```

---

### 3. **Terraform Configuration Files**

#### `main.tf`
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Ubuntu AMI for us-east-1, change if needed
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "king" # Replace with your SSH key name
  user_data     = file("install_apache.sh")

  tags = {
    Name = "ApacheServer"
  }
}

output "instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
```

---

### 4. **Initialize & Apply Terraform**

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

This will:
- Provision a new EC2 instance
- Run the Apache installation script on it via `user_data`
- Output the public IP

---

### 5. **Write the IP Address to a Local File**

After applying, capture the IP using Terraform output and save it to a file:

```bash
terraform output -raw instance_ip > instance_ip.txt
```

---

### ðŸ§¹ Optional: Destroy the Instance After Testing

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
