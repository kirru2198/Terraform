Tasks To Be Performed:
 1. Destroy the previous deployment
 2. Create a new EC2 instance with an Elastic IP

---

Great! Here's a **step-by-step Terraform guide** to create a new **EC2 instance with an Elastic IP (EIP)** in AWS.

We’ll:
1. Create a VPC, subnet, and other network components (or use default VPC).
2. Launch an EC2 instance.
3. Associate an Elastic IP with it.

## ✅ Step-by-Step: EC2 Instance with Elastic IP using Terraform

---

### 📁 1. Directory Structure
```bash
ec2-with-eip/
├── main.tf
├── outputs.tf
└── variables.tf (optional)
```

---

### 📄 2. `main.tf`
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"  # Ohio region
}

# --- EC2 Instance ---
resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-05fb0b8c1424f266b"  # Amazon Linux 2023 in us-east-2
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  # Automatically use default subnet
  subnet_id = data.aws_subnet.default_subnet.id

  associate_public_ip_address = true

  tags = {
    Name = "EC2-With-EIP"
  }
}

# --- Get Default Subnet in a specific AZ ---
data "aws_subnet" "default_subnet" {
  default_for_az      = true
  availability_zone   = "us-east-2a"
}

# --- Elastic IP ---
resource "aws_eip" "my_eip" {
  instance = aws_instance.my_ec2.id
  vpc      = true
}
```

---

### 📄 3. `outputs.tf`
```hcl
output "ec2_instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.my_ec2.id
}

output "ec2_public_ip" {
  value = aws_eip.my_eip.public_ip
}
```

---

### 📄 4. `variables.tf` (Optional if you want to make values configurable)
You can skip this if you are hardcoding AMI/instance_type.

---

### 🧪 5. Deploy Using Terraform
```bash
terraform init         # Initialize Terraform
terraform plan         # Preview resources
terraform apply        # Create resources
```

When prompted, type `yes`.

---

### ✅ Result
- EC2 instance is launched in `us-east-2a` (Ohio).
- It gets an **Elastic IP** assigned.
- Public IP is shown in outputs.

---

Great catch! That warning is from the **`aws_eip`** resource, which **deprecated the `vpc = true` argument**. Instead, you should now use the `domain = "vpc"` argument.

---

### ✅ **Fix: Replace `vpc = true` with `domain = "vpc"`**

---

### 🔧 Updated `aws_eip` Resource (Fixed)
```hcl
resource "aws_eip" "my_eip" {
  instance = aws_instance.my_ec2.id
  domain   = "vpc"  # 👈 replaces deprecated 'vpc = true'
}
```

---

This will remove the warning and still create an EIP in your default VPC context.

---

Let me know if you want to associate the EIP **using `aws_eip_association`** instead (more flexible and decoupled).

### 🔧 Notes
- If using your own VPC and subnet, replace the `data "aws_subnet"` with your own `resource "aws_subnet"`.
- You can also create and attach a **security group**, **key pair**, or **user_data** script if needed.
